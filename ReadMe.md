# just some examples of node.js apps to demonstrate features

## hello world example

I didn't like the standard node.js hello world example so I
expanded on it to show a few more features. I also added a
number of comments to explain the code.

- webs.js is the fully commented version of the code for a simple webserver that collects some info, reads a file, builds a web page and then serves that page to any browser who makes a request. It shows a bit of the async nature of node.js and shows how first class functions are important.
- websunc.js is the same code with all comments stripped. It is good for displaying in a blog where the blog article does the explaining rather than the
code comments.
- sample.txt is just a text file which is read in and included in the web page. The purpose of this is to show how non-blocking file io is done.
